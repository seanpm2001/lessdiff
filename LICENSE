This is public domain; use however you wish. The only 'impressive' thing here
(and 'impressive' is a HUGE exaggeration!) is the concept; the script
itself is very simple (though I comment on it). I would appreciate if you keep
the headers intact however, if you use it, 'just because, as the saying goes.
Thank you.
